### About
graph-editor is an electron-webpack/react app for designing graphs and editing live neo4j databases.

Note: Graph Editor is uses the Graph Diagram library ([https://wwlib.github.io/graph-diagram/](https://wwlib.github.io/graph-diagram/)) which is a TypeScript port of a graph-editing project called Arrows, originally created by Alistair Jones at Neo4j ([http://www.apcjones.com/arrows/](http://www.apcjones.com/arrows/), [https://github.com/apcj/arrows](https://github.com/apcj/arrows)).

-Use the New Neo4j button to create a connection to a live neo4j database
- set the connection url, user, password, etc.

```
"connection": {
  "type": "neo4j",
  "url": "bolt://localhost:7687",
  "user": "neo4j",
  "password": "<PASSWORD>",
  "initialCypher": "MATCH (n)-[r]-(p) return n,r,p limit 100"
}
```
